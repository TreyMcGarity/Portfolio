        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <img src="./images/resumePic.jpg">
        <p>I graduated from highschool in 2017; futhermore, I graduated with a Associates Degree majoring in Computer Science from Motlow State Community College. In my opinion traditional schooling wasn't preparing me for career in development, so I changed gears.</p>
        <h3></h3>
        <p>I am currently a part-time student at Lambda School for Full Stack Web Development. I appreciate the focus of the curriculum of Lambda because it's specifically job-like development training and there is a plethora of advisors and peers to help Lambda students along the way.</p>
