        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <img src="./images/resumePic.jpg">
        <p>My legal name is Jerry Glenn McGarity III. I graduated from highschool in 2017; futhermore, I graduated with a Associates Degree majoring in Computer Science from Motlow State Community College in the summer of 2019. In my opinion traditional schooling wasn't preparing me for career in development, so I changed gears.</p>
        <p>Cell number: (256)929-3066</p>
        <h3></h3>
        <p>I am currently a part-time student at Lambda School for Full Stack Web Development. I appreciate the focus of the curriculum of Lambda because it's specifically job-like development training and there is a plethora of advisors and peers to help Lambda students along the way.</p>
        <p>I believe Lambda will help me to start a honest, successful career as a developer!</p>

            <h3>Build Week Project</h3>
            <p>Save The Animals was my first build week project, and it was simply a marketing page to advertise an app that users and corporations could make donations to various humanitarian efforts.</p>
            <p>Built using HTML and LESS.</p>
            <a href="https://lets-save-the-animals.netlify.com/">Save the Animals</a>
            <br>
            <h3>Favorite Github Repositories</h3>
            <p>JavaScript-III was the project where prototypes were introduced through making a simple, fun text-based game.</p>
            <p>Built using vanilla JavaScript.</p>
