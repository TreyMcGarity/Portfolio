  <h3 id="about">About Myself</h3>
  <div class="about">
    <article class="education">
      <p>Currently, I am a member of the Engineering Support Team at TPG INC in Huntsville, Al. 
        I facilitate user licenses, management of the databases, and compile reports for other departments at the company.
        Since having the opprotunity to move to this position, I have learned a lot about production relational databases and SQL. 
      </p>
      <p>Also, I am completeing my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science concentration in Software Engineering at Colorado Technical University. 
        My fascination with computer hardware and especially software including the web sparked when I was in high school and has never dwindled.
        I feel fortunate that I am able to learn and do what I've been passionate about since I was a kid, and I've decided to under take the Full Stack
        of these broad Sciences to be better capable in successfully completeing any challenge that comes my way or vice versa!
      </p>
      <p>My web skills come from a bootcamp I participated in and it deep dove me into a world of interesting and fun things that can be done over the web.
        Creating interfaces, APIs, and databases to handle the desired functionality of the modern world has pleasantly forced me to be prepared for any
        issue.
